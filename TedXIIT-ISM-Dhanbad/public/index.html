				<h3>Why Attend TEDxIITDhanbad?</h3>
				<p align="justify">TEDxIITDhanbad is a non-profit independent TEDx community devised to foster lateral thinking and revere inspirational creativity. After organizing a host of various detached events over the years , we realized that in order to change the intellectual landscape of our academic epicentre, a continual effort in the right direction was required. After fervent attempts and vigorous endeavours of procuring the license and curating a vivacious team of deft individuals, we formed TEDxIITDhanbad, with an underlying principle of inspiring the society by challenging the prosaic human perception at it's roots. We aim to promote offbeat reasoning of unorthodox doctrines and spark protean conversations in the society through our diverse mix of speakers. Join us as we host our maiden TEDx event, the <q>"Devil's advocate"</q> edition</p>
				<p align="justify">The TED philosophy, consists of one sentence, <q>"it's about simplified, authentic storytelling."</q> Which seems to fit well with its mission of, <q>"ideas worth spreading"</q>. Combine both with a remarkable TEDx organizer and speaker and you get the 18 minute presentation equivalent of  a Hollywood blockbuster.</p>
				<p align="justify">TEDx is a powerful event because its organizers don't do it for the money or the fame - for which there is neither. They do it to make a difference. And people that do things out of passion, do them better.</p>

But, seldomare all aspirants provided equal opportunities to prove themselves. With a just cause of levelling the playing field , Mr. Abhishek Sagar co-founded testbook.com, an online preparation course engine. Initially staring out as a channel for GATE preparation, IIT-Delhi alumnus Mr.Sagar ensured that testbook adapted quickly and expanded to cater to those preparing for railway and bank exams as well. As the the Head of the Technical Team, he pioneered the efforts of creating an app for the same after realising that not every aspirant has a laptop, but is most likely to possess a smartphone. Now handling the 1.3 lakh registered users alongside many others who've availed the current affairs app provided by Testbook.com, we're proud to present Mr.Abhishek Sagar as a speaker at TEDxIITDhanbad this year.</p></div></div>

But what if we told you that they possess the potential to inspire and reshape the course of one&#39;s life? Ms. Ria Sharma, was a student of fashion whose life underwent radical changes after viewing an oscar winning documentary on acid attacks in Pakistan. This inspired her to do what only a fraction of us dare to - to pursue what she felt was right, to rid people of the devastating plight that follows acid attacks. What started off as an expedition for a short film transpired into the beginning of &quot;Make love not scars&quot;, an NGO set out to curb and end acid attacks across the country. Quite ironically, the globally renowned rehabilitation centre for attack victims in Delhi functions with only one fundamental- to render itself obsolete within the coming decade. Join us as we host Ms.Sharma giving out her premier tedx talk this October.</p></div></div>

On the flip side, there exist a plethora of college students plagued by boredom, who scribble away ingenious thoughts on the back of their notebooks. As an initiative of unifying these polar opposites, scribbled stories has pioneered the advent of micro fiction in India. Starting out as a personal endeavour, Mr.Mohit Kumar had to expand eventually after receiving a overwhelming number of entries requesting to be published.

As erroneous as it may sound, beatboxing can actually be traced back to the early 13th century.

Realising his calling at the age of 18, Mr.Vincent turned from a professional emcee to a full time beatboxer. With a streak of successful shows and associations (1200 in 9 years), along with his Guinness world record, it is hard not to miss his blog, where we believe lies his true masterpiece. Yes, his beatboxing is exquisite, but after reading his blogs, we found it difficult to let go of such a free-spirited individual.

		<p align="justify">Nothing in the world is more dangerous than sincere ignorance and conscientious folly. Yet, it is hard to remain unwavered by the views of a prejudiced society. In the acceptance of a widely acknowledged tenet, the banal aspects are often overlooked and buried. This year, we intend to resurrect such oblivious stories that the incognizant society has missed. The views and rationale that few have braved to open up about, those whose very whiff threatens to shatter human perception as we know it. The underlying theme of TEDx at IITDhanbad this year is <q>"the Devil's Advocate"</q>. We aim to present to you the other side of the coin, the devil's turf of conservative dogmas. With robust arguments and a flipped sense of discernment to bend your manner of thinking , we hope to trigger virtuous ideas free of any bigotry whatsoever.</p>
